Branches in Git are needed to:
Several programmers can work on the same project or file at the same time without interfering with each other.
Test experimental features. 
In order not to damage the main project, a new branch is created specifically for experiments. 
If the experiment is successful, the changes from the experimental branch are transferred to the main one. If not, the new branch is deleted, and the project remains untouched.
